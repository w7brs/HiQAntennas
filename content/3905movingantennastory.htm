Hi Charlie...<br />
<br />
When I take a couple of days off, it&#39;s usually a week or so until I get caught 
up at work. I will do an official report shortly which will also be published on 
the 3905 web page. <br />
<br />
For now, here&#39;s a synopsis of what transpired with a couple of pictures 
attached.<br />
<br />
15 contestants. <br />
First Place - AA1NZ - Hi-Q - Score 118.8 <br />
Second Place - NJ9T - Predator - Score 115.2<br />
Third Place - K0WJ - Predator - Score 104.4<br />
Fourth Place - WA3EOP - Hi-Q - Score 78.1 (micro car - Ford Festiva)<br />
Next Scores were: 73.6, 51.9, 37.6, 34.8, 30.8, 18.4, 13.5, 9.9, 5.9, 2.7, and 
1.7 (hamstick on roof mag mount)<br />
<br />
It was really super. On Thursday night and Friday, I drove into the Eyeball site 
with a Hamstick mounted on the car (you can see the double mounts in my pics). I 
only went in with the Hi-Q attached on Saturday morning just before the shoot 
out started. You just can&#39;t imagine the jaws dropping when I showed up with 
that. And another thing...While driving on the streets of Hanover, PA on the way 
to the shootout, people walking on the sidewalks would just stop and look up at 
that beauty on the roof of the car. They would just stand there looking up and 
with their mouth wide open !!! It was perfect. <br />
<br />
I&#39;ll send more later.<br />
<br />
Tom AA1NZ</p>
