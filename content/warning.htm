We use TELEDROP &quot;G&quot; meter to monitor the shipping companies ABUSE of the Hi-Q 
antenna shipment.<br />
<br />
Please look for the RED device and observe if the ARROW has been triggered to a 
BLUE color.<br />
It it was triggered INSPECT the antenna for full function as it has gone thru an 
un acceptable DROP EXEEDING the listed &quot;G&quot; force on the TELEDROP. <br />
If damaged occurred MUST REPORT IT to the CARRIER and inform Hi-Q as well.<br />
<br />
NOTE: So far ALL of the shipment has TRIGGERED to 50 &quot;G&quot; drop WITH OUT ANY 
damage to the Hi-Q antenna!<br />
That is whey we called it the RUGGEDIZED HF antenna.<br />
